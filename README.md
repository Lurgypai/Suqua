# Suqua
A 2D networked game library.

## Content
This is a set of game libraries for 2D (or 3D if you want to manually write the OpenGL) games, with a focus on organizational tools, and handling netcode. The dream is to be able to (almost) seamlessly develop networked games that have little lag, with no concern for managing the synchronization of data manually.

# THIS IS A VERY WORK IN PROGRESS
